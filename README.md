## Information Gathering
+ 1st step of any pen test and involves gathering/collecting information about an individual, company, or website you are targeting
+ Typically described as 2 types
++ Passive - gathering information without actively engaging target
++ Active - gathering information by actively engaging with the target system (BE SURE TO GET AUTHORIZATION)
+ This initial phase of gathering information about the target server/web app is considred the most important phase of the engagement by many
+ Record everyhing (no such thing as unnecessary information that has been collected)

## Passive Information Gathering
+ This is where we want to identify domain names and ownership information
+ Discover hidden/disallowed files and directories
+ Identify web server IP addresses and DNS records
+ Identify web technologies used on target sites
+ Identify website content structure (even by crawling or spidering)
+ WAF detection

## Active Information Gathering
+ Downloading and analyzing website/web app source code
+ Port scanning and service discovery
+ Web server fingerprinting
+ Web application scanning
+ DNS Zone Transfers
